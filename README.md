# Spatial Analysis using R
This Repository uses R to perform interpolation procedure on input data of type **.csv**. The following Spatial interpolation techniques are explored:
  1. Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)
  2. Thin Plate Spline (TPS)
  3. Nearest Neighbor (NN)
  4. Ordinary Kriging

## Data Input
Data used for this project is about water quality. Surface water Quality and Ground water quality collected across India and particulally area in:
  1. Uttar Pradesh.shp
  2. Madhya Pradesh.shp
  3. Andhya Pradesh.shp

## Libraries used
The following libraries were used for data cleaning, analysis and visualization:
  1. ggplot2 - Visualization
  2. sp
  3. sf - reading shp.
  4. raster - read and write rasters
  5. gstat - for kriging
  6. Among others...
